This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before the component has mounted.  This often happens inside the constructor or other lifecycle methods that run before `componentDidMount`.  The component's state might not be initialized yet, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: this.props.initialData // Error: this.props might be undefined
    };
  }
  // ...
}
```
